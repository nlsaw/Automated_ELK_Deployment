In examining the player_loss data we have determined Mylie Schmitd id a player who was present at every major loss. 
Mylie was present in all 13 cases of major loss on March 10, 12 and 15. The losses were at the same times each day.


In examining the Dealer_schedules data using the information gained from player_loss we have discovered that the
dealer Billy Jones worked at the tables at every instance of loss involving Mylie Schmidt. Billy's schedule matched
with major losses to Mylie Schmidt at all 13 instances.

Due to this pattern observed where all losses feature Mylie and Billy is working the roulette at every time it
occurred we conclude that Billy Jones is colluding with Mylie Schmidt to scam Lucky Duck.
